# This is my first portfolio

Hello! This is going to be my first portfolio as a front-end web developer - and it is also one of the responsive web design projects in FreeCodeCamp. That is the reason why it is made out of simple and plain HTML and CSS! My goal is to practice some of the concepts seen in the lessons: flexbox, grid, positioning...

## Creating the portfolio

In order to review my knowledge of positioning, flexbox and grid in CSS, I have decided to use all three in the development of the portfolio. Thus, I have used flexbox to create the navigation bar, grid to create the _What I've done_ section and relative, fixed and absolute positioning to both place the navigation bar in proper place and also de hero image/s. All of this whilst making sure the design is fully responsive, which has been the biggest challenge - **specially considering I decided to position the images without flex nor grid!**

That being said, I tried to build a simple and minimal yet easthetic page. I hope I have achieved it! Also, the images are logograms from the movie _Arrival_ (Denis Villeneuve, 2016). **Amazing movie, if you haven't watched it, go check it out!**
## About me!
