# This is my first portfolio

Hello! This is going to be my first portfolio as a front-end web developer. 

In the first place I will work on the design and the development of the actual portfolio webpage, and then I will start working on further projects which I will therefore add so you can all check my work and my progress. The first pages will follow the guidelines of the [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org) _Responsive Web Design Certification_.


## About me!

**This is /didac3141592's portfolio** and it is the result of the different exercices and projects I had to carry out during the Front-end Web Development course I'm enrolled in: _Singulars 2020 - Front-end Web Development_ by **PIMEC & Netmind & Barcelona Technology School**. 

You can check me out in my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/didac3141592/).

Happy coding!
