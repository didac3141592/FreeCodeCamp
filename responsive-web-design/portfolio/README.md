## Creating the portfolio

In order to review my knowledge of such I have decided to use both in the development of the portfolio. Thus, I have used **flexbox** to create the navigation bar and **grid** to create the _What I've done_ section. That being said, I tried to build a simple and minimal yet easthetic page. I hope I have achieved it! 

Also, the images are logograms from the movie _Arrival_ (Denis Villeneuve, 2016). **Amazing movie, if you haven't watched it, go check it out!**
