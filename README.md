# FreeCodeCamp Projects

In this directory I will upload the projects I complete out of the [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org) webpage. Hence, the directory structure will follow the one they introduce: 

1. Responsive Web Design
2. JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures
3. Front-end Libraries
4. etc

## Responsive Web Design

1. Tribute page
2. Survey form
3. Product landing page
4. Technical documentation page
5. Personal portfolio webpage

In this section I have tried to focus on practicing the usage of the flexbox model and the grid model in order to make the challenges fully responsive. I have also tried to involve the SASS preprocessor in the design of some of them to get used to this widely used tool and its applications.

## JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures
