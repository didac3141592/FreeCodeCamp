# FreeCodeCamp

In this directory I will upload the projects I complete out of the [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org) webpage. In order to do that, I will be following the same structure as them:

1. Responsive Web Design
2. JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures
3. Front-end Libraries
4. etc

## Responsive Web Design

In this directory you'll be able to see the 5 mandatory projects needed to obtain such certification. These are:

1. Tribute page
2. Survey form
3. Product landing page
4. Technical documentation page
5. Personal portfolio webpage

and are **mostly built out of plain HTML5 and CSS3**.

I have tried to focus on practicing the usage of the flexbox model and the grid model in order to make them fully responsive. I have also tried to involve the SASS preprocessor in the design of some of them.
